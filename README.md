# I Dream of Parking

This was a project created for my Software Engineering (CSC 190) course at Hofstra University. The objective of this project was to design, document, and create an operational program over the course of one semester, all while working within a team.

I Dream of Parking is a program designed to be used anywhere there is a large parking lot that would benefit from automating parking space assignment to drivers. The program accomplishes this by assigning the most frontward, and outward parking spaces in each row and column. The user would pull into a ticket booth and be told where to park, and would receive a ticket for them to place in their dashboard after parking. The program was designed with a default parking lot containing 120 parking spaces (2 columns of 6 rows of 10 spaces).

For the course requirements 3 documents were created: a Requirements Specification, Project Plan, and Architecture and Design Overview. These documents were used to illustrate the project before and during its development.

This program was coded in C# with the use of JSON as a database and WinForms for the GUI.
